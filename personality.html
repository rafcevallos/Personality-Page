    <h1>The Mediator</h1>
    <p>Mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better.<br> While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, Mediators have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the population,<br>the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the Mediator personality type – but when they find like-minded people to spend their time with,<br>the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration.</p>
    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Idealistic – Mediators’ friends and loved ones will come to admire and depend on them for their optimism. Their unshaken belief that all people are inherently good, perhaps simply misunderstood, lends itself to an incredibly resilient attitude in the face of hardship.</li>
        <li>Seek and Value Harmony – People with the Mediator personality type have no interest in having power over others, and don’t much care for domineering attitudes at all. They prefer a more democratic approach, and work hard to ensure that every voice and perspective is heard.</li>
        <li>Dedicated and Hard-Working – While others focusing on the challenges of the moment may give up when the going gets tough, Mediators (especially Assertive ones) have the benefit of their far-reaching vision to help them through. Knowing that what they are doing is meaningful gives people with this personality type a sense of purpose and even courage when it comes to accomplishing something they believe in.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Too Idealistic – Mediators often take their idealism too far, setting themselves up for disappointment as, again and again, evil things happen in the world. This is true on a personal level too, as Mediators may not just idealize their partners, but idolize them, forgetting that no one is perfect.</li>
        <li>Too Altruistic – Mediators sometimes see themselves as selfish, but only because they want to give so much more than they are able to. This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they try to push themselves to commit to a chosen cause or person, forgetting to take care of the needs of others in their lives, and especially themselves.</li>
    </ul>
